        <h1>Tensor Flow Demo</h1>
        <p>Hey, I'm <a href="http://pjwalker.net">Paul</a>. I'm a full stack javascript developer and a curious mind. I've been wanting to get my head around tensor flow and modern machine learning paradigms for a while now. The release of <a href="js.tensorflow.js">tensorflowJS</a> was just the kick in the tush that I needed.</p>
        <p>The following demos are based on <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/">these tutorials</a>. Some of the code I borrowed (where I did, I made a note of it in the source) but most of it I rewrote in a TDD workflow in order to fully understand what is happening.</p>

        <h3>Our model</h3>
        <p>Our model is based on the quadratic equation with the following coefficients. We add some noise and generate a pile of training data. Here's a graph of the line and the generated training data.</p>
