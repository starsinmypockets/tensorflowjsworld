# Hello tensorflowjs
I've been wanting to sink my teeth into tensorflow since I first heard about it, but have been avoiding the major context-swap to python... Welcome tensorflowjs!

The examples here are taken from https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/ 
As an exercise, I re-wrote selected  examples in my own code and added tests to help understand the code better.
